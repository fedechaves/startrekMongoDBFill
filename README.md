## How It's Made:
-Started the back-end from 0, with the help of 100Devs community, especially mayanwolfe. The clientside is from TheLCARS.com and the LCARS Inspired Website Template designed & developed by Jim Robertus. 

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express and Mongo DB.

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.


## Lessons Learned:
-Even if the database is incomplete, this webapp helps me practice CRUD app concepts.
-Build it in community makes it easier because you have the chance to really comprehense what you are doing, that makes a richer experience.
